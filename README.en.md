### Mod introduction

The joint ban mod allows servers that have installed it to collectively ban a group of troublemakers. 
 
With the gradual improvement of the blacklist, this mod may effectively create a better gaming environment.


To report troublemakers, please leave a message in the comments or visit:

https://github.com/ylk2534246654/dst-mod-joint-ban/issues

- Please provide the following information:
```
userID:
steamID:
Reason:
Screenshot:
```
userID refers to the id in the game that starts with KU_
steamID refers to the 17-digit number id in the steam profile page
At least one id must be provided, and it is recommended to provide both for better banning effectiveness.

To prevent easy unblocking, please provide a screenshot. 
You can upload the screenshot to an image hosting site and provide the link in the screenshot.
One third-party image hosting site is provided here: https://p.sda1.dev

If you are wrongly banned, you can provide relevant information for unblocking. However, if the violation is confirmed, the ban will not be lifted.

The blacklist is synchronized after each server restart.
